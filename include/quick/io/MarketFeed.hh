/// @brief Handles incoming market data from the network
///
/// This class encapsulates all logic related to receiving market data:
/// - TCP connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
/// - Receiving raw bytes and parsing into MarketData structs
/// - Pushing data into a lock-free queue for downstream processing
/// - Connection recovery with exponential backoff
/// - Performance metrics tracking
///
/// @section thread_safety Thread Safety
/// - receive_loop() is designed to be called from a dedicated thread
/// - All public methods are thread-safe through atomic operations
/// - The queue reference must remain valid for the lifetime of this object
///
/// @section error_handling Error Handling
/// - initialize() returns std::expected for recoverable connection errors
/// - receive_loop() catches all exceptions and logs them (never throws)
/// - Connection failures trigger automatic reconnection logic
